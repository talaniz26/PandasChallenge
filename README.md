**Charter vs. District Schools Budget:**
Bailey High School:
Has the maximum budget of $3,124,928.00.
Despite having a high budget, it is not among the top-performing schools, suggesting that there may be areas for improvement in the allocation of resources.
Holden High School:
Has the lowest budget of $248,087.00.
Huang High School:
Has a higher budget per student ($655.00).
Despite the higher budget per student, it is noted as one of the bottom-performing schools, indicating a potential misalignment between budget allocation and academic performance.
Wilson High School:
Allocates a lower budget per student ($578.00).


District vs. Charter Schools:
The total district schools budget is higher ($17,347,923.00) than the total charter schools budget ($7,301,505.00).
However, when considering the budget per student, charter schools have a higher allocation per student ($4,796.00) compared to district schools ($4,505.00).
This difference may be attributed to the fact that charter schools have a smaller number of students.
It's important to note that while budget considerations are crucial, academic performance is influenced by various factors, and the relationship between budget allocation and educational outcomes can be complex. The insights you've provided suggest areas for further investigation and potential adjustments in resource allocation to enhance overall educational quality. It might be valuable for administrators to analyze the effectiveness of budget utilization and consider strategies for improvement, especially in schools where there seems to be a misalignment between budget and performance.
